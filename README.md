## 🛠️ Skills Showcased

This project was a hands-on tour of key Power BI features. Highlights:

- ⚙️ **Power Query (Data Prep / ETL)** — Cleaned and shaped raw data: handled blanks, fixed data types, and created helper columns so the dataset was analysis-ready.  
- 🧮 **Implicit measures & simple calculations** — Used visual-level aggregations and basic measures to surface metrics like median yearly salary and total job count.  
- 📊 **Core visualizations** — Built column, bar, line, and area charts to compare roles and reveal trends over time.  
- 🗺️ **Geospatial mapping** — Plotted job locations on map visuals to reveal geographic patterns and hotspots.  
- 🔢 **KPIs & detail tables** — Designed cards for top metrics and sortable tables for drillable, row-level detail.  
- 🎨 **Dashboard design** — Created a clear, user-friendly layout and chose chart types that best answer each question.  
- 🖱️ **Interactive UX** — Added interactivity to explore the data:
  - **Slicers** for quick filtering (e.g., by Job Title)  
  - **Buttons & Bookmarks** to navigate report views smoothly  
  - **Drill-through** pages to jump from summary visuals into deeper, contextual detail
